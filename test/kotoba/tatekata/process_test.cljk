  "Parity-in-spirit tests for `kotoba.tatekata.process`.

  `kami-app-tatekata::process.rs`'s `#[test]` block (`process_loads_and_plans`,
  `plan_phases_are_ordered`) asserted against the REAL upstream
  `process.json`, which is not present in this checkout (see
  `kotoba.tatekata.process`'s ns docstring). These tests instead exercise the
  same properties — ops resolve in seq order; a representative step's action
  set spans procure/deliver/<build>/inspect; `build-start < build-end`;
  `op-at` at the very start returns the procure op; `build-progress` is ~0 at
  p=0 and ~1 at p=1; `logistics-at` is nil while procure is active — against
  the small synthetic fixture at `resources/kotoba/tatekata/process-ops.edn`."
